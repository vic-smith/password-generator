# Password Generator 
## This project was really challenging for me.

-The first thing I did was make sure that the onClick initiated the application functions.
-After that I used prompts to gather input information from the user.
-As the user answers the prompts, variables are pushed to an array. 
-The final array is iterated through by the for loop that generates a random password at a length determined by the user.
